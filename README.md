Preprocessing steps taken were to transform the text to lowercase, perform word tokenization, eliminate stopwords from the tokens, remove punctuation marks from the tokens, and eliminate empty space tokens. These were done for words excluding the phrase query where only the text was lowered. Thus the phrase query has stopwords in them that need to be kept. Some assumptions made were the phrase query or simple query was formed from the dictionary, as an example if a query is “lowercase words” then lowercase is spelt this way not lower-case or lower case. Another assumption is that the user wants the query to have stopwords and spaces, to make it easier for them to understand and interpret the output. However, the rest of the document is preprocessed is another assumption. The next assumption is that the positions in the positional index data structure and the document ids start at 0 and not 1. The last assumption made is that a user will input a query like the examples given in the lecture slides for positional index, like a single word for a query and a phrase query of 5 or less words. The methodology is functional programming because many built in functions are used in the code and some functions were created to be reused or for helping the readability of the code. A brief description of the outputs is that if the user’s query is a phrase then the positional index for the query phrase is given for only the query phrase and nothing else or else the full output would not be shown. Additionally, the output will also have the number of retrieved documents and the list of file names. If the query is not a phrase then the positional index will be the output along with the number of retrieved documents and the list of file names.
